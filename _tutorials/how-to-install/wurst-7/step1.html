		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<details>
			<summary>My antivirus is detecting the Fabric installer as malicious.</summary>
			<p>
				This can happen with the Fabric installer "for Windows" (the .exe version), but it's almost certainly a false positive. You can either ignore the warning or use the Universal/.jar version of the Fabric installer, which does not have this problem.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>When I try to run the Fabric installer, nothing happens.</summary>
			<p>
				This can happen when you don't have Java installed. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0vPUwitJs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">video on how to install Java</a>.

		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>When I try to run the Fabric installer, WinRAR / 7-zip / etc. opens instead.</summary>
			<p>
				This means your computer is configured to open .jar files with that other program instead of using Java.
				There is a setting in Windows called "Choose default apps by file type" that lets you change this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, you can also use "right click" > "open with" to open the file with Java, like so:<br>

				<ul>
					<li>If you don't see Java in the list, select "Choose another app" at the bottom.</li>
					<li>Depending on your system, you will see either "Java(TM)&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;SE&nbsp;binary", "OpenJDK&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;binary", or both. It doesn't matter which one you use.</li>
					<li>If you can't find Java at all, you need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0vPUwitJs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">install Java</a> first.<br>

				<li>If you want to use snapshots, make sure that "Show snapshots" is checked first.</li>
				<li>Leave "Select Install Location" at the default value. Changing this can sometimes cause problems.</li>
				<li>Leave "Create profile" checked. That way you don't have to make your own profile.</li>
