		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<details>
			<summary>When I try to download Wurst, Chrome warns me that the file "isn't commonly downloaded".</summary>
			<p>
				This can happen when a new version has just been released.
				It just means that you're one of the first people to download that specific version of Wurst.
				You can safely ignore this warning and download the file anyways.

		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<details>
			<summary>Where do I find my <code>.minecraft</code> folder?</summary>
			<p>
				<b>Windows:</b> Open your Windows Explorer and type <code>%appdata%/.minecraft</code> into the address bar.<br>
				(Alternatively you can press Win+R and type in the same thing.)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Linux:</b> Open your File Explorer and type <code>~/.minecraft</code> into the address bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Mac:</b> Open your Finder and type <code>~/Library/Application Support/minecraft</code> into the address bar.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>There is no <code>mods</code> folder in my <code>.minecraft</code> folder.</summary>
			<p>
				You have skipped the previous step. You should <a href="#fabric-api">go back to step 2</a> and install the Fabric API first.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>My Wurst Client file doesn't have the Java icon on it. It has a WinRAR logo instead.</summary>
			<p>
				Check the file extension. As long as it ends with <code>.jar</code>, everything is fine.
				It simply means that your computer is configured to open .jar files with WinRAR instead of Java.
			</p>
			<p>
				It doesn't matter for this file, since it's still a .jar file and will still work,
				but if you want to fix it there is a setting in Windows called "Choose default apps by file type" that lets you change this.
