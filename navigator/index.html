        Navigator is much faster than ClickGUI, both FPS-wise and productivity-wise. Some people spend over 45s looking through the ClickGUI searching for a certain mod, but Navigator's integrated search bar can do that for you in a matter of milliseconds.

        Do you want to know what BookHack does or how ServerFinder works? No you can find out! Every feature in Wurst can have a tutorial button on its Navigator page, making it easier than ever to get started with features that you're not familar with.

        Mods, Commands and Special Features - Now they're all in one place. And instead of just having a small toggle button, every feature has its own page containing its description, settings, keybinds, and more.

      <h2>See Navigator in Action</h2>
      <p>
        Our Wurst 2.13 update video shows you what Navigator looks like in the real world and explains in detail how it works and why it's faster, easier and more flexible than any other GUI out there.

      <h2>Powerful Search</h2>
      <p>
        Navigator's search bar uses ranking by relevance and meta tags to ensure that you get the best possible results. Unlike most in-game search engines, including Minecraft's creative inventory search, Navigator won't simply list the features that have your search term in the title. We even use Google Analytics (if enabled in Wurst Options) to analyze the searches and ensure that everyone gets what they're searching for.

      <h2>Easy Keybinds</h2>
      <p>
        Navigator makes keybinds easy: You just click the "+" button on the keybinds section of a feature, select what the keybind should do and what key should trigger it. Unlike the Keybind Manager, Navigator doesn't require you to remember the command for the thing you want to keybind, making the entire process of keybinding as easy as clicking on a few buttons.

      <h2>Fully Responsive</h2>
      <p>
        Too big for your screen? No problem! Everything in Navigator is scrollable and will automatically adjust itself to your screen size. Whether you're using a giant 4K monitor or a tiny 600x800 screen, Navigator will always look great on it.

      <h2>Optimized Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Navigator runs roughly 4 times faster than ClickGUI (exact numbers may vary). It is designed to handle thousands of features without slowing down, so it has no problems handling the 150+ features that we got so far. It also doesn't rely on the Darkstorm API for any of its rendering, giving the Wurst developers full control over it.

      <h2>Intelligent Sorting</h2>
      <p>
        If Google and Amazon can learn your preferences, why shouldn't Wurst be able to do the same thing? Navigator remembers what features you use the most and puts them right at the top so you won't need to search them.

      <h2>Complex Settings</h2>
      <p>
        Settings in Navigator go far beyond the simple sliders that we had in ClickGUI. And now that every feature has its own page with virtually infinite space, the amount of settings a feature can have is no longer limited to the height of your screen. This allows us to make Wurst far more customizable and allows some long requested settings to finally be added.
