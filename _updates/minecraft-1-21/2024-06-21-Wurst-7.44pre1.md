## Changelog

- Added "Guide" and "Guide color" settings to AirPlace. When "Guide" is enabled, it shows a preview of where the next block will be placed. "Guide color" determines the color of the preview. ([#1016](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1016), [#1014](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1014))

- Made more of the in-game descriptions for settings translatable.

- Added more Japanese translations. ([#1011](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1011), [#1013](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1013))

- Improved existing Chinese (Simplified) translations. ([#1008](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1008))

- Fixed ArrowDMG no longer increasing your arrow damage in Minecraft 1.21. Unfortunately the old method of increasing arrow damage no longer works in 1.21, possibly because [MC-137719](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-137719) was fixed. Instead, ArrowDMG now uses a different method of increasing damage, which is less powerful but works in the new version.

- Replaced ArrowDMG's "Packets" slider with a "Strength" slider. This new slider maxes out at 10, which is also its default value.

- Fixed a crash when using ModMenu v11.0.0 or later with its default "Game menu: Replace" setting. ([#1018](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1018))
