## Changelog since v7.44pre1

- Added MaceDMG: Increases your damage when attacking with a mace. It's about equivalent to falling 22 blocks, dealing ~64 points of damage per attack.

- Increased the amount of damage you can deal with ArrowDMG. It still doesn't reach the crazy high values that were possible in Minecraft 1.20.6, but it's about twice as powerful as it was in v7.44pre1.

- Added a "Pause for mace" setting to NoFall. When enabled, NoFall will pause itself whenever you are holding a mace, so that you can take advantage of the mace's fall distance bonus and the Wind Burst enchantment, with the downside of not being protected from fall damage while you are holding a mace. ([#1012](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1012), [video demo](https://youtu.be/SoEpumdz4qw))

- Fixed AutoSword not seeing the mace as a weapon. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- When AutoSword's "Priority" setting is set to "Damage (axes)", it will now take into account how many blocks you have fallen and select a mace if it would deal higher damage. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- Fixed AutoMine stopping whenever you open a screen (chat, inventory, etc). ([#1029](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1029))

## Changelog since v7.43.2

- Added MaceDMG: Increases your damage when attacking with a mace. It's about equivalent to falling 22 blocks, dealing ~64 points of damage per attack.

- Added a "Pause for mace" setting to NoFall. When enabled, NoFall will pause itself whenever you are holding a mace, so that you can take advantage of the mace's fall distance bonus and the Wind Burst enchantment, with the downside of not being protected from fall damage while you are holding a mace. ([#1012](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1012), [video demo](https://youtu.be/SoEpumdz4qw))

- Fixed AutoSword not seeing the mace as a weapon. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- When AutoSword's "Priority" setting is set to "Damage (axes)", it will now take into account how many blocks you have fallen and select a mace if it would deal higher damage. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- Added "Guide" and "Guide color" settings to AirPlace. When "Guide" is enabled, it shows a preview of where the next block will be placed. "Guide color" determines the color of the preview. ([#1018](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1018), [#1014](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1014))

- Made more of the in-game descriptions for settings translatable.

- Added more Japanese translations. ([#1011](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1011), [#1013](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1013))

- Improved existing Chinese (Simplified) translations. ([#1008](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1008))

- Fixed ArrowDMG no longer increasing your arrow damage in Minecraft 1.21. Unfortunately the old method of increasing arrow damage no longer works in 1.21, possibly because [MC-137719](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-137719) was fixed. Instead, ArrowDMG now uses a different method of increasing damage, which is less powerful but works in the new version.

- Replaced ArrowDMG's "Packets" slider with a "Strength" slider. This new slider maxes out at 10, which is also its default value.

- Fixed AutoMine stopping whenever you open a screen (chat, inventory, etc). ([#1029](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1029))
