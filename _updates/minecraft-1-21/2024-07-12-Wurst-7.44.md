## Changelog since v7.43.2

- Added MaceDMG: Increases your damage when attacking with a mace. It's about equivalent to falling 22 blocks, dealing ~64 points of damage per attack.

- Added a "Pause for mace" setting to NoFall. When enabled, NoFall will pause itself whenever you are holding a mace, so that you can take advantage of the mace's fall distance bonus and the Wind Burst enchantment, with the downside of not being protected from fall damage while you are holding a mace. ([#1012](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1012), [video demo](https://youtu.be/SoEpumdz4qw))

- Fixed AutoSword not seeing the mace as a weapon. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- When AutoSword's "Priority" setting is set to "Damage (axes)", it will now take into account how many blocks you have fallen and select a mace if it would deal higher damage. ([#1015](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1015))

- Added "Guide" and "Guide color" settings to AirPlace. When "Guide" is enabled, it shows a preview of where the next block will be placed. "Guide color" determines the color of the preview. ([#1016](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1016), [#1014](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1014))

- Fixed ArrowDMG no longer increasing your arrow damage in Minecraft 1.21. Unfortunately the old method of increasing arrow damage no longer works in 1.21, possibly because [MC-137719](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-137719) was fixed. Instead, ArrowDMG now uses a different method of increasing damage, which is less powerful but works in the new version.

- Replaced ArrowDMG's "Packets" slider with a "Strength" slider. This new slider maxes out at 10, which is also its default value.

- Fixed combat hacks stopping whenever you open a screen (chat, inventory, etc), even if the "Pause on containers" setting is disabled. ([/d/644](https://wurstforum.net/d/644), [/d/637](https://wurstforum.net/d/637), [/d/631](https://wurstforum.net/d/631), [/d/595](https://wurstforum.net/d/595))

- Fixed AutoMine stopping whenever you open a screen (chat, inventory, etc). ([#1029](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1029))

- Fixed an issue where a server could detect that a Wurst installation is not vanilla Minecraft by sending you a specially crafted resource pack containing fake Wurst keybinds and then using the sign translation exploit to detect that these strings were being blocked from translation.

- Wurst now uses a custom translation system instead of Minecraft's built-in one, and Wurst's zoom keybind is now a TextFieldSetting in the Zoom feature rather than a vanilla Minecraft keybind. You won't notice either of these changes, but they are very important for security. It means that now, anything that Wurst does with its translations and keybinds cannot possibly affect Minecraft's own translations and keybinds, because the two are now entirely separate systems.

- While I have your attention, would you mind yelling at Mojang to finally fix the [sign translation exploit](https://wurst.wiki/sign_translation_vulnerability)? Just a little bit? It's insane that Minecraft has had a known security vulnerability for [over a year](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w14a) at this point, which is being exploited in the wild too, and they aren't doing anything about it. [MC-265322](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-265322) isn't even marked as a security bug (and the security implications aren't obvious from how that report is worded). Maybe they actually don't know? Anyway, back to the changelog.

- Made more of the in-game descriptions for settings translatable.

- Added more Japanese translations. ([#1011](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1011), [#1013](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1013))

- Improved the existing Chinese (Simplified) translations. ([#1008](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1008))

- Fixed AntiHunger not modifying sent packets as intended. ([#1031](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1031))

  **Note:** There have been reports of some users receiving extra fall damage when using AntiHunger, but the exact cause of this issue is still unknown. Please let me know if you find a way to reliably trigger this bug. ([#1036](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1036), [/d/660](https://wurstforum.net/d/660))

- Replaced a Redirect mixin with WrapOperation to improve compatibility with other mods. ([#1035](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1035))
