## Changelog since v7.45.1

- Added [VeinMiner](https://wurst.wiki/veinminer): Automatically mines ore veins for you. Just click on a vein and it will take care of it. You can also configure it to treat other things as veins than just ores.

  ![screenshot of VeinMiner settings in Wurst 7.46, including Range (1-6), Flat mode (on/off), MultiID list (list of block types), Swing hand (client/server/off), Max vein size (1-1000), and Check line of sight (on/off)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca232ee-3cd9-4d4f-b9d0-47b02f02e620)

- Added an "Opacity" slider to X-Ray. Allows you to change the opacity of non-ore blocks when X-Ray is enabled. This makes it possible to still see your surroundings while having X-Ray enabled, and it also doubles as an alternative to CaveFinder. Opacity is turned off by default, because it doesn't work when Sodium is installed. If you aren't using Sodium, I'd highly recommend enabling this setting for a much better x-raying experience. ([#1024](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1024))

- Completely rebuilt [MobSpawnESP](https://wurst.wiki/mobspawnesp) from the ground up, which should fix many sporadic crash issues that plagued the old version. ([#978](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/978), [#1062](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1062), [/d/707](https://wurstforum.net/d/707), [/d/718](https://wurstforum.net/d/718))

- Added "Night color", "Day color", and "Opacity" settings to MobSpawnESP.

- Removed MobSpawnESP's "Loading speed" slider.

  ![screenshot of MobSpawnESP settings in Wurst 7.46, including Draw distance (3x3 chunks - 33x33 chunks), Night color (RGB color code), Day color (RGB color code), Opacity (0-100%), and Depth test (on/off)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8984a4a-16af-4083-a5df-76f5995909bd)

- Added a "Shape" setting to Nuker, NukerLegit and SpeedNuker. Allows you to break blocks around you in a cube shape (kind of like Tunneller) instead of the default sphere shape. Note that the cube shape works best at low range values like 1-3, since you need to be able to reach the corners. ([#379](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/379))

- Moved the "Flat" option in Nuker's, NukerLegit's, and SpeedNuker's "Mode" setting to a dedicated "Flat mode" checkbox. This allows you to combine Flat mode with other modes like ID.

- Added a "Swing hand" setting to Nuker, NukerLegit, and SpeedNuker.

  ![screenshot of Nuker settings in Wurst 7.46, including Range (1-6), Shape (Sphere/Cube), Flat mode (on/off), Mode (Normal/ID/MultiID/Smash), ID (block type), Lock ID (on/off), MultiID list (list of block types), and Swing hand (client/server/off)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/281790f3-4c31-4253-bbc3-aa60c825e843)

- Refactored how Nuker, NukerLegit, SpeedNuker, Kaboom and AutoFarm work.

- Nuker, NukerLegit, and SpeedNuker no longer change their name in HackList based on which mode they are in. For example, `IDNukerLegit [coal_ore]` will now be displayed as `NukerLegit [ID:coal_ore]`. This also means the alphabetic sorting of these HackList entries is no longer wrong.

- Nuker will now prioritize blocks that you have line of sight to over blocks that are obstructed. When mining, this means Nuker is more likely to select the ore that you expected, rather than going after some other ore patch behind a wall that is technically closer.

- Fixed NukerLegit getting stuck staring at a block without mining it when you open your inventory.

- Increased NukerLegit's maximum range to 4.5.

- (Users have reported that this new version of NukerLegit is also better at bypassing anti-cheat plugins like Vulcan. It wasn't specifically designed to do this, but a quick test against Vulcan 2.9.0 seems to confirm these reports.)

- Fixed BlockComponents (like Nuker's ID setting) rendering above other ClickGUI windows that are supposed to be in front of it.

- Added checkboxes to Kaboom that allow you to turn off the explosion sound and particles.

- Updated Kaboom's description and added descriptions to its settings.

- Fixed AutoMine breaking blocks impossibly fast and turned that bug into an optional feature. There is now a "Super fast mode" checkbox in AutoMine that restores this behavior.

- Added a "Bite mode" setting to AutoFish. Allows you to choose how AutoFish tries to detect bites. Sound mode is the old behavior, where it listens for the bite sound. Entity mode looks directly at the fishing hook's entity update packet, which means you don't need to worry about other people's bites being detected as yours. However, servers can prevent Entity mode from working by sending spoofed packets. ([#1054](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1054))

- Improved X-Ray's performance when "Only show exposed" is enabled.

- Removed clay from X-Ray's default list of ores, as it's quite common in lush caves and can block your view of more valuable ores.

- Fixed BonemealAura, FeedAura, and Tillaura not working when you are riding on a horse or other vehicle. ([#1063](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1063))

- Changed some of the UI in AltManager to remove confusion about [cracked vs. premium alts](https://wurst.wiki/altmanager#cracked_vs_premium_alts). ([/d/790](https://wurstforum.net/d/790))

- The "Add" button on the "New Alt" screen now says either "Add Cracked Alt" or "Add Premium Alt", depending on which type of alt you're about to add.

- The "Login" button on the "Direct Login" screen now says either "Login with Password" or "Change Cracked Name", matching what it's going to do when you press the button.

- Added an "Account type" text on the "New Alt", "Edit Alt", and "Direct Login" screen that always tells you whether you are working with a cracked alt or a premium alt.

- Wurst's setting descriptions can now be made out of multiple translated and untranslated components. This makes it possible to translate more complicated setting descriptions like the one for the "Swing hand" setting.

- All of Wurst's "Swing hand" settings are now fully translatable.

- Updated Gradle to v8.10 and Gradle GitHub actions to v4.

- Added support for Fabric Loader JUnit, which makes it possible to automatically test _some_ parts of Wurst. Minecraft is notoriously difficult to write unit tests for and even Mojang struggles with this. I don't expect we'll ever reach 100% coverage, but it still seems useful to have unit tests the few areas where it's easy to add them.

- Added a few initial unit tests for Wurst's rotation logic, used primarily in combat hacks like Killaura. This should help to prevent issues with Wurst turning the wrong way when it tries to face something, which is a bug that often appeared and reappeared in the past.

- Added support for Build Scans, which display a lot of useful debug information every time the Gradle CI GitHub action runs. This can help to troubleshoot issues when the code doesn't compile or when tests are failing, among other things.

- Added the [creaking heart](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Creaking_Heart) to X-Ray's default list of ores. (24w40a and later versions only)
