## Changelog

- Added [VanillaSpoof](https://wurst.wiki/vanillaspoof): Bypasses anti-Fabric plugins by pretending to be a vanilla client. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ThisTestUser" target="_blank">ThisTestUser</a>!)

- Added more keyboard shortcuts to [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator). (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/aleksilassila" target="_blank">aleksilassila</a>!)
  - Arrow Keys: change which feature is selected.
  - Tab: select next feature (same as right arrow).
  - Shift+Tab: select previous feature (same as left arrow).
  - Enter: toggle selected feature (same as left-clicking on a feature).
  - Space: expand selected feature (same as left-clicking on the arrow next to a feature).

- Added [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) integration: Automatically reports crashes so you don't have to.

- [AutoSteal](https://wurst.wiki/autosteal) now supports shulker boxes. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pikami" target="_blank">pikami</a>!)

- Analytics will now change the random user ID every 30 days to make extra sure that you remain anonymous.

- Renamed the "Analytics" button in Wurst Options to "Count Users" and improved its description to make it more clear what this actually does:

  >Counts how many people are using Wurst
  >and which versions are the most popular.
  >We use this data to decide when to stop
  >supporting old Minecraft versions.
  >
  >We use a random ID to tell users apart
  >so that this data can never be linked to
  >your Minecraft account. The random ID is
  >changed every 30 days to make extra sure
  >that you remain anonymous.

- Updated the links in the Wurst Options.

- Fixed a rare bug in PotionSaver that kicks you from the server.

## Update: Wurst 7.7.1

- Fixed Sentry reporting crashes with obfuscated code. It will now deobfuscate stuff before reporting it.
