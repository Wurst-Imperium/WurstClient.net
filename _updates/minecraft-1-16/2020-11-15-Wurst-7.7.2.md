## Changelog

- Wurst MC 1.15.2 is now properly marked as incompatible with really old Fabric API versions (older than 0.12.1) that cause it to crash. (Thanks to Sentry!)

- Fixed ForceOP crashing the game if you get kicked from the server just before pressing the "start" button. (Thanks to Sentry!)

- Fixed a crash when using MassTPA. (Thanks to Sentry!)

- Fixed a crash when a Wurst event is fired before the EventManager is ready. (Thanks to Sentry!)

- Fixed Sentry reporting a crash that is known to be caused by VoxelMap 1.10.11.

- Fixed Sentry reporting a crash that is known to be caused by Fabritone 1.6.1.

- Fixed a spammy log message when using Wurst in a development environment.
