## Changelog

- Added [SnowShoe](https://wurst.wiki/snowshoe): Allows you to walk on powder snow.

- Added an "Export" button to AltManager. Allows you to make plain text backups of your alt list.

- Added JSON support to AltManager's "Import" and "Export" buttons.

- Renamed the "Use" and "Star" buttons in AltManager to "Login" and "Favorite" to make it more clear what these buttons do.

- Added a "Filter babies" checkbox to [FeedAura](https://wurst.wiki/feedaura). (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mersid" target="_blank">Mersid</a>!)

- The random ID for counting users is now changed every 3 days instead of every 30 days.

- Fixed a crash when using [AutoMine](https://wurst.wiki/automine).

- Fixed a rare crash when using AltManager.

- Fixed a rare crash when using RemoteView.

- Fixed a crash when [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild) tries to load a template file that is corrupted.

- Fixed a crash when disconnecting from a server while Wurst is disabled.

- Fixed CaveFinder not resetting properly when moving to different dimension.

- Fixed CaveFinder not working properly on low render distances.

- Removed the [backspace shortcut](https://wurst.wiki/navigator#keyboard_shortcuts) from Navigator's main screen, since it was interfering with the search bar. It still works on the "feature" screen, since that one doesn't have a search bar.

- Removed the Sentry integration.
