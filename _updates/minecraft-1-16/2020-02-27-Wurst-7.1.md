## Changelog

- Added [`.binds load-profile <file>`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/binds) and `.binds save-profile <file>` commands.
  
  These commands allow you to save all of your keybinds into a profile and then load that profile whenever you want.
  
  You can have multiple profiles, each with a different set of keybinds in them. You can also keybind the `.binds load-profile` command to instantly switch to a different profile.
  
  This way, you are no longer limited by the number of keys on your keyboard. You can have INFINITE KEYBINDS!!!

- Added a "Profiles..." button to the Keybind Manager that lets you manage your keybind profiles without using chat commands.

- Added a [`.binds list-profiles`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/binds) command.

- Added [`.bind`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/bind) and [`.unbind`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/unbind) commands for people who are more used to that kind of syntax.

- Added a `.enabledhax` command that allows you to make profiles of enabled hacks.
  
  You can have a separate profile for every server/situation and switch between them at a moments notice. Gone are the days of toggling 50+ hacks by hand!

- Added a `.settings` command that allows you to make profiles of your settings.
  
  Just found the perfect settings for Hypixel Skyblock but now you want to play on Mineplex instead? No problem! Save those settings to a profile and get back to them whenever you want.

- Added TooManyHax: Blocks any features that you don't want. For those who want to "only hack a little bit". Allows you to make sure that you don't accidentally enable the wrong hack and get banned for it.

- Added `.toomanyhax`: Allows to manage which hacks should be blocked when TooManyHax is enabled. Also allows you to make profiles for TooManyHax!

- Fixed a crash when using OptiFabric. (see <a href="https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/62" target="_blank">issue #62</a> for details)

- Fixed the strange input lag of [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator's search bar.

- Fixed a visual glitch when moving [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator's scrollbar with the left mouse button.

- Fixed a visual glitch where, when scrolling down in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator)'s list of features and then typing something into the search bar, some or all of the search results wouldn't show up.

- Fixed a visual glitch when using Fabritone. (see <a href="https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/53" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Issue #53</a> for details)
