## Changelog

- Added a "Legit" mode to FastBreak. Only removes the delay between breaking blocks, without speeding up the breaking process itself. This is slower, but usually bypasses anti-cheat plugins. Use it if regular FastBreak is not working.

- FastBreak will now display its mode/speed in the HackList.

- Improved the reliability of AutoFish.

- Changed the [category](https://wurst.wiki/categories) of AutoSwitch from "Other" to "Items".

- Changed the [category](https://wurst.wiki/categories) of [AutoSteal](https://wurst.wiki/autosteal) from "Other" to "Items".

- Added a description to [AutoSteal's "Delay" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autosteal#delay).

- Pressing the ["Steal" and "Store" buttons](https://wurst.wiki/autosteal#stealstore_buttons) very quickly will now work as expected.

- Improved the description of Liquids.

- Added a tooltip to sliders saying that you can ctrl-click them for precise input.

- Fixed [AutoMine](https://wurst.wiki/automine) mining more slowly than it should.

## Update: Wurst 6.30.1

- Fixed `.features` crashing the game.
