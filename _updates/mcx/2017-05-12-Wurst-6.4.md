## Changelog

- Improved [`.binds`](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/cmd/binds) so that it can actually manage your keybinds and not just list them.

- The Keybind Manager will now allow you to make keybinds that run the same command multiple times.

- When binding a key to multiple commands, the Keybind Manager will now remember the order in which you specified the commands.
