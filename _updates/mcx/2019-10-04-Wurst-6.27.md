## Changelog

- Added a ["Block" setting](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search#block) to Search that determines the type of block to search for.

- Removed `.search`, as Search's "Block" setting makes it obsolete.

- [Search](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search) will now target `minecraft:diamond_ore` by default.

- [Search](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search) will now scan whole chunks instead of individual blocks.

- Added an ["Area" setting](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search#area) to Search that determines the area around the player in which it will search. (default: 11x11 chunks)

- [Search](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search) can now search an area of up to 33x33 chunks!

  That's an area of 528 x 528 x 256 blocks, or a volume of over 71,000,000 blocks, or a range of ~264 blocks.

  Previous versions were limited to a range of 50 blocks, or an area of 101 x 101 x 101 blocks, or a volume of ~1,000,000 blocks.

- Added a ["Limit" setting](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search#limit) to Search that determines the maximum number of blocks to display. (default: 10,000 blocks)

  Previously the limit was locked to 1,000 blocks. Now you can set to up to 1,000,000 blocks if your PC can handle it.

- Greatly improved the performance of [Search](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/search) to allow for the increased range and block limit.

- Added color support to `.modify`. Use $ for colors, use $$ for $.

  Example: `.modify add {display:{Name:'{"text":"$cRed Name"}'}}` (changes the item's name to <span style="color: #ff0000">Red Name</span>)

- Fixed a typo in the description of `.features`.

## Update: Wurst 6.27.1

- Fixed [PlayerESP](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/playeresp)'s filter for invisible players being controlled by "Filter sleeping" instead of "Filter invisible".
