- Fixed the ClickGUI not rendering locked/disabled/limited sliders properly.

- [Navigator](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/navigator) will now render settings in the same way that ClickGUI does. (tooltips for descriptions, drop-down menus for mode/enum settings, etc.)

- [Navigator](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/navigator) will now support all the same mouse & keyboard shortcuts that ClickGUI does. (right click to reset, CTRL-click to type in slider value, etc.)
