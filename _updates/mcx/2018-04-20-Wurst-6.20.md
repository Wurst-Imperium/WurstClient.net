## Changelog

- Improved the GUI of ForceOP.

- Improved the error message that ForceOP displays if all login attempts fail.

- Added a "Filter flying" setting to Killaura so you can filter out flying bots from Watchdog, etc.

- Increased the maximum value of Killaura’s "Range" setting to 10 blocks.

- Added a "Priority" setting to Killaura so you can choose to prioritize targets by angle, by distance or by health.

- Fixed PlayerESP Tracers not rendering in blue for players that are on your friends list.

- AutoArmor can now consider the Protection enchantment when calculating armor strength. (optional)

- AutoArmor will no longer try to swap armor pieces while the player is moving (though you can re-enable this behavior in the settings).

- AutoArmor will now prefer armor pieces of better materials, even if the number of defense points is the same.

- AutoArmor will no longer swap armor pieces in a predictable order.

- AutoArmor's delay between swapping pieces of armor can now be configured through a slider - or be disabled altogether by setting the slider to 0.
