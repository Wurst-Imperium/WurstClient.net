## Changelog

- Fixed zooming in with the mouse wheel changing the selected slot.

- Zoom will now dynamically adjust your mouse sensitivity while zooming, so that high levels of zoom will not cause the camera to move too quickly. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mersid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mersid</a>!)

- Added a "Check held item" setting to BuildRandom. When checked, BuildRandom only builds while you are actually holding a block. Turn this off to build with fire or if you just want to right click with an empty hand in random places.

- Added an "Always FastPlace" setting to BuildRandom. Builds as if FastPlace was enabled, even if it's not.

- Improved BuildRandom's search tags. For example, searching "place random", "random build" or "random place" will now find BuildRandom.

## Update: Wurst 6.29.1

- Fixed BoatFly not having a category.
