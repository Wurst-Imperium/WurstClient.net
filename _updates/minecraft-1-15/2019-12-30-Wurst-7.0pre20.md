## Changelog

- Added ServerCrasher: Generates an item that can crash 1.15.x servers. (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Alienantony" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@Alienantony</a>!)

- Added `.viewnbt`: Shows you the NBT data of an item.

- Alt Manager is back!

- Alt Manager now saves its encryption keys in ".Wurst encryption" instead of ".ssh".

- Added a readme file to the ".Wurst encryption" folder to explain why it exists and why you should NEVER send it to someone else.

- The alt list is now saved as "alts.encrypted_json" to make it more clear that it's an encrypted file and to avoid compatibility issues with older versions of Wurst.

- The "Import Alts" button can now also import alts without a password.

- Known issues: Alt Manager's skin preview and skin stealer features are currently not working.

- **Update:** This version has a bug that causes the game to crash on startup for users running Mac OS and some Linux distros. This will be fixed in v7.0pre21, but if you need to use Wurst on New Year's Eve and you don't have a Windows machine, I recommend using v7.0pre19 for now.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
