**NOTE:** Snapshot 22w14a has a tendency to crash at random. This is not a bug in Wurst. ([MC-249933](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249933))

## Changelog

- Added [ArrowDMG](https://wurst.wiki/arrowdmg): Massively increases arrow damage, but also consumes a lot of hunger and reduces accuracy.

- Added support for Microsoft accounts to [AltManager](https://wurst.wiki/altmanager). Just type in your email and password as before. AltManager will automatically detect if it's a Mojang or Microsoft account and log you in appropriately. ([#590](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/590) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EliteUn17y">EliteUn17y</a>!)

- AltManager uses Minecraft's `client_id` for Microsoft logins instead of registering its own. This way, any login using Wurst will just look like regular Minecraft and not leave any evidence that Wurst was used.

- Improved the error messages on AltManager's "Direct Login" screen. All of the new messages are [documented on the wiki](https://wurst.wiki/altmanager#error_messages_and_what_they_mean). (You would be surprised how many things can go wrong during a Microsoft login.)

- For now, AltManager still freezes the game while logging in. This is much more noticeable with Microsoft accounts, since the login process is so complex and involves connections to so many different servers. Expect each login to take 3-10 seconds, or up to 30 seconds if your internet connection is unreliable. More time is needed to improve performance and add a progress bar and cancel button.

- For now, AltManager still saves the email and password of Microsoft alts and re-generates the tokens every time you login. More time and careful consideration is needed to improve the alt list file format so that it can save these tokens without completely breaking compatibility with older versions.

- Added Cantonese (Hong Kong) translations for all 154 currently translatable strings. ([#555](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/555), [#591](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/591) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SistineFibelKen">SistineFibelKen</a>!)

- Added Russian translations for 10 strings and changed Russian translations for 58 strings. ([#580](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/580) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/PanForPancakes">PanForPancakes</a>!)

- Added Polish translations for 7 strings and changed translations for 3 strings. ([#585](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/585) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ZANX3Y">ZANX3Y</a>!)

- Added Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translations for 4 strings. ([#587](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/587) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wosk0x01">wosk0x01</a>!)

- Added German translations for 7 strings.

- Added a "[right-click] to reset" tooltip on sliders.

- Fixed a crash when [AltManager](https://wurst.wiki/altmanager) doesn't have permission to access its '.Wurst encryption' folder. AltManager will now show an error message instead, telling the user to fix their file permissions and warning them that alts can't be saved until then. AltManager remains usable even if permissions are not fixed, it just won't save anything.

- Fixed a typo in the [Flight](https://wurst.wiki/flight) and [CreativeFlight](https://wurst.wiki/creativeflight) descriptions. ([#566](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/566) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcm1k">pcm1k</a>!)

- Fixed Wurst's AI not working below y=0. ([#571](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/571) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcm1k">pcm1k</a>!)
