**WARNING:** This version is [known to crash](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/625) when used with Fabric API v0.51.0. The older Fabric API versions linked below still work fine.

## Changelog

- Added [InvWalk](https://wurst.wiki/invwalk): Allows you to move around while the inventory is open. ([#414](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/414) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/TheWienerMaster">TheWienerMaster</a>!)

- Added a ["Target hunger" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#target_hunger) to AutoEat. Tries to keep the hunger bar at or above this level, but only if it doesn't waste any hunger points.

- Added a ["Min hunger" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#min_hunger) to AutoEat. Tries to keep the hunger bar at or above this level, even if it wastes hunger points. The default value will not cause any waste unless you are playing with modded food items. If you don't care about food waste, max out this slider to keep the hunger bar full at all times.

- Added an ["Injured hunger" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#injured_hunger) to AutoEat. Tries to keep the hunger bar at or above this level when you are injured. Ignores wasted hunger points to ensure quick healing in an emergency.

- Added an ["Injury threshold" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#injury_threshold) to AutoEat. Stops the "Injured hunger" setting from being activated by tiny wounds.

- Added a ["Take items from" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#take_items_from) to AutoEat. Determines where AutoEat will look for food.

- Added an ["Allow offhand" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#allow_offhand) to AutoEat. Determines whether or not AutoEat can use food in your offhand.

- Added a "Damage indicator" checkbox to [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) and [KillauraLegit](https://wurst.wiki/killauralegit). Allows you to turn off the damage indicator. ([#618](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/618) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sudofox">sudofox</a>!)

- Added Japanese translations for 20 strings and changed translations for 137 strings. ([#606](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/606), [#612](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/612) - Thanks to skidderrom and yuta2312!)

- Added Polish translations for 3 strings. ([#613](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/613) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ZANX3Y">ZANX3Y</a>!)

- Changed Russian translations for 6 strings. ([#572](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/572) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ti-bone">ti-bone</a>!)

- Changed Chinese (Simplified/Mainland) translations for 1 string. ([#617](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/617) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MineYuanlu">MineYuanlu</a>!)

- Added German translations for 12 strings.

- Removed the ["Prefer food with" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autoeat#prefer_food_with) in AutoEat, since it would no longer work as expected with the new algorithm.
