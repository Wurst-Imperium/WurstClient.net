## Changelog

- The [Alt Manager](/wiki/Special_Features/Alt_Manager/) will no longer log you in multiple times when adding or editing an alt. That means you will no longer get IP-banned from Mojang’s login servers, unless of course you manually log in multiple times.

- Improved the search bar in [Navigator](/wiki/Mods/Navigator/). It now knows a lot more synonyms for the different hacks. For instance, if you search for "SpeedyGonzales", it will now find [FastBreak](/wiki/Mods/FastBreak).

- Added articles on the [Wurst Wiki](/wiki/Main_Page/) for all features that didn't have one before. Some of them are stub articles and you can help us by expanding them.

- The Alt Manager now supports unchecked alts.



- Double clicking on an alt in the Alt Manager will now do the same thing as selecting it and pressing the “Use” button.

- [FastLadder](/wiki/Mods/FastLadder/) will now climb ladders roughly 15% faster (community contribution by ThisTestUser).

- Fixed [Killaura](/wiki/Mods/Killaura/) not properly bypassing when hitting entities behind the player.

- Fixed the Alt Manager not saving alts for some people.

## Update: Wurst 2.21.1 Changelog

- Fixed Killaura (and some other auras) doing weird things when entities are outside of your range. Wurst 3.2 will have the same fix for Minecraft 1.9.X.

## Update: Wurst 2.21.2 Changelog

- Fixed the Auto-Updater constantly trying to update to Wurst 2.21.1 despite already having it.
