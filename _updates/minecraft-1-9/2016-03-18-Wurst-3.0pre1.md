Back in the day when I [updated Wurst to Minecraft 1.8](https://old.wurstclient.net/news/wurstforminecraft18-firstpre-releaseavailable), I made a pre-release as soon as I got a somewhat working version and then kept making more pre-releases until it was stable. The update to Minecraft 1.9 will work the same way.

**Working features:**

- Most [commands](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/command#list_of_commands)
- FastPlace
- [Flight](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/flight)
- All Killauras & TriggerBot
- Movement hacks ([Spider](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/spider), Glide, etc.)
- ServerFinder

**Broken features:**

- [AutoArmor](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autoarmor)
- AutoSoup
- AutoSplashPot, .potion, etc.
- [AutoBuild](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autobuild), [BuildRandom](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/buildrandom), etc.
- [BowAimbot](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/bowaimbot) & Trajectories
- All ESPs

Everything not listed above is untested and could be either working or broken. The auto-updater _should_ be working, but I cannot guarantee it.

**If you get a crash:**
Delete `modules.json` in your Wurst folder (default location: `%appdata%\.minecraft\wurst`).
