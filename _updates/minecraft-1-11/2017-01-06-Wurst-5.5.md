## Changelog

- Added ScaffoldWalk: Automatically places blocks below your feet.

- AutoSoup will now also work with rabbit stew and beetroot soup.

- AutoSoup can now also eat soup while the inventory, a chest or any other kind of screen is open. This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the "Ignore screen" checkbox.

- The AutoSoup Health slider now uses hearts instead of health points and AutoSoup will now start eating when the player's health reaches the set value instead of waiting until it goes below that value.

- The AutoSoup Health slider is now set to 6.5 hearts by default, as most servers seem to restore 3.5 hearts per soup.

- AutoSplashPot can now also throw potions while the inventory, a chest or any other kind of screen is open. This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the "Ignore screen" checkbox.

- The AutoSplashPot Health slider now uses hearts instead of health points and AutoSplashPot will now start throwing potions when the player's health reaches the set value instead of waiting until it goes below that value.
