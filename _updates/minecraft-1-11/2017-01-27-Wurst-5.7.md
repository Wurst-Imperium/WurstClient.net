## Changelog

- Redesigned ChestESP, making it easier to tell the difference between a chest that has never been opened, a chest that has been emptied by the player and a chest that has been opened but not emptied.

- ChestESP will now tell you how many chests it found.

- Improved performance of ChestESP (we have measured a 5-10x improvement).

- ChestESP is no longer limited to 1000 chests.

- ChestESP will now remember all of the chests that you have opened (previously limited to 64 chests). Disabling and re-enabling ChestESP will still reset its memory.

- BowAimbot will now start aiming before the bow is fully drawn if it is already possible to hit the target.

- Redesigned BowAimbot.

- Improved MobESP, PlayerESP and Tracers: They will now draw smoother lines with brighter colors.

- Redesigned ProphuntESP.

- Fixed ChestESP not remembering which chests you have already opened in multiplayer.
