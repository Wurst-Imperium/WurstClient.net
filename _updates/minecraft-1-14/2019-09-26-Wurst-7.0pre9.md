## Changelog

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.14.4, 19w38b and 19w39a.
  
  **Warning:** The rendering in 19w39a is very broken. Most ESPs won't work.

- [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) is back!

- Added a ["Block" setting](https://wurst.wiki/search#block) to Search that determines the type of block to search for. (`.search` will not be added back, as this setting makes it obsolete.)

- [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) will now target `minecraft:diamond_ore` by default.

- [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) will now scan whole chunks instead of individual blocks.

- Added an ["Area" setting](https://wurst.wiki/search#area) to Search that determines the area around the player in which it will search. (default: 11x11 chunks)

- [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) can now search an area of up to 33x33 chunks!

  That's an area of 528 x 528 x 256 blocks, or a volume of over 71,000,000 blocks, or a range of ~264 blocks.

  Previous versions were limited to a range of 50 blocks, or an area of 101 x 101 x 101 blocks, or a volume of ~1,000,000 blocks.

- Added a ["Limit" setting](https://wurst.wiki/search#limit) to Search that determines the maximum number of blocks to display. (default: 10,000 blocks)

  Previously the limit was locked to 1,000 blocks. Now you can set to up to 1,000,000 blocks if your PC can handle it.

- Greatly improved the performance of [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) to allow for the increased range and block limit.

- [`.taco`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/taco) is back!

- Updated Fabric API to 0.3.3+build.234-1.14 / 0.3.4+build.238-1.15 / 0.4.2+build.244-1.15.

## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

{% include update-features.html %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
