## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

### GUIs:

Currently there is only the window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

**Note:** If you can't open the ClickGUI by pressing Right CTRL, try using the following command (in the Minecraft chat): <code>.binds&nbsp;reset</code>

[Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) and TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
