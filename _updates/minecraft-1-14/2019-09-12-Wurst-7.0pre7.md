## Changelog

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.14.4 and 19w37a.

- Added ItemGenerator - Generates random items and drops them on the ground. (Creative mode only)

  If you max out the speed, this hack can crash servers quite easily.

- `.drop` is back!

- Added `.drop slow` command for servers that limit how quickly you can drop items.

- Removed `.drop infinite`, as ItemGenerator makes it obsolete.

- Added AutoDrop - Automatically drops unwanted items.

- [AutoSprint](https://wurst.wiki/autosprint) is back!

- Added AutoSwim - Triggers the swimming animation automatically.

- [AutoWalk](https://wurst.wiki/autowalk) is back!

- [BunnyHop](https://wurst.wiki/bunnyhop) is back!

- [Dolphin](https://wurst.wiki/dolphin) is back!

- Added Fish - Disables underwater gravity so you can swim like a fish.

- Added new easter eggs.

- Added a "Box size" setting to MobESP, [PlayerESP](https://wurst.wiki/playeresp) and ItemESP.

  - **Accurate** mode shows the exact hitbox of each mob / player / item.

  - **Fancy** mode (default) shows slightly larger boxes that look better.

- Updated Fabric API to 0.3.2+build.224-1.14 (MC 1.14.4) / 0.3.2+build.225-1.15 (MC 19w37a).

## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

{% include update/features.html %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
