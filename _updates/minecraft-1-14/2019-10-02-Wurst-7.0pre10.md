## Changelog

- Fixed [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray) not working when OptiFine / OptiFabric is installed.

- [AutoMine](https://wurst.wiki/automine) is back!

- AutoRespawn is back!

- `.t` is back!

- Added a "Method" setting to Fullbright:

  **Gamma** works by setting the brightness to beyond 100%. It supports the Fade effect, but isn't compatible with shader packs. This is what previous versions of Wurst did, and it's selected by default.

  **Night Vision** works by applying the night vision effect. This looks a bit different and _usually_ works with shader packs, but it doesn't support the Fade effect.

- Added a description to Fullbright's "Fade" checkbox.

- Added a "Legit mode" setting to FastBreak. Only removes the delay between breaking blocks, without speeding up the breaking process itself. This is slower, but usually bypasses anti-cheat plugins. Use it if regular FastBreak is not working.

- Added a tooltip to sliders saying that you can ctrl-click them for precise input.

- Fixed [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) searching for air blocks if you try to search for a block that doesn't exist.

- Removed the ability for [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) to search for air blocks at all, as it creates a lot of lag and there is no practical use for it.

- Fixed ClickGUI not calculating the width of windows properly.

- Fixed the description of HackList's "Mode" setting.

## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

{% include update/features.html %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
