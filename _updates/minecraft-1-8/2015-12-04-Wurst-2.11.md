## Changelog

- Lots of performance improvements, including a faster ModManager, CommandManager and FileManager.

- Added ClickAura: Automatically attacks the closest valid entity whenever you click. Warning: ClickAuras generally look more suspicious than Killauras and are easier to detect. It is recommended to use Killaura or TriggerBot instead.

- Added MenuWalk: Allows you to walk while viewing a menu (e.g. the inventory menu)

- Added `.repair` Command: Repairs items in Creative Mode.

- Improved Wurst capes and added support for Wurst HD skins. Those will hopefully be available soon.

- Faster SpeedHack: It will now be 2.5x faster than sprint-jumping. **Update:** NoCheat+ patched SpeedHack in version 3.13.2. :(

- AntiPotion will now block all bad potion effects.

- Cleaned up lots of code.

## Update: Wurst 2.11.1

- Hotfix for MenuWalk crash.

- Fixed a bug with options.json getting corrupted.

## Update: Wurst 2.11.2

- Fixed the version indicator still saying "v2.11", causing the auto-updater to keep re-downloading v2.11.1.
