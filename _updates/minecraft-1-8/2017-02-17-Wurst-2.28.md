## Changelog

- ChestESP's memory of previously opened chests is no longer limited by the render distance.

- PlayerESP and Tracers will no longer render on sleeping players and invisible players if those are disabled in the Target settings.

- MobESP will no longer render on invisible mobs if those are disabled in the Target settings.

- PlayerESP, MobESP, ItemESP and Tracers will now use interpolation for smoother rendering.

- You can now remove a server from the multiplayer screen by pressing the <kbd>delete</kbd> key. This method bypasses the usual "Are you sure?" dialog, allowing you to quickly remove a bunch of servers without having to use Clean Up.

- Improved the performance and reliability of AntiSpam.

- Updated links in the Wurst Options.

- Improved the colors of sliders.

- Fixed locked checkboxes, sliders and color selectors not updating properly (a.k.a. Killaura ignoring the Target settings).

- Fixed FOV calculations (a.k.a. Killaura sometimes not attacking anything).

- Fixed locked checkboxes not updating properly.

- Fixed YesCheat+ not correctly blocking some things.
