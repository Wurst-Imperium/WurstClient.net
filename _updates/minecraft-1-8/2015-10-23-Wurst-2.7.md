## Changelog

- Added AntiMAC: Makes other mods bypass Mineplex AntiCheat or blocks them if they can't.

- Improved Blink: You can now virtually blink forever while standing still. The milliseconds counter will only increase while you are moving.

- The in-game version indicator at the top left will now say "(outdated)" if a new update is available.

- Fixed some rare crashes.

- Fixed some mods deactivating after closing Wurst while Blink is enabled.

- Removed name & skin preview in the "Add Alt", "Edit Alt" and "Direct Login" screens.
