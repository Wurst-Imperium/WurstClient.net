## Changelog

- Added "Use swords as tools" checkbox in AutoTool. Disabling this will prevent AutoTool from selecting swords, even if a sword would be the fastest tool to mine the block that you are looking at.

- Improved the speed of Nuker and Tunneller.

- Improved the Nuker animation.

- Fixed the Nuker animation playing twice when using Nuker and Overlay at the same time.

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk.

- Fixed AutoTool sometimes selecting the wrong tool.

- Fixed some issues with fake players created by Freecam and RemoteView.
