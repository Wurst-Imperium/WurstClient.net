## Changelog

- BlockHit: Automatically blocks whenever you hit something with a sword. Some say that you will receive less damage in PVP when doing this.

- Packet Sneak bypass: Sneak will now let you sneak at full walking speed, even on NoCheat+ servers.

- Improved ClickGUI performance.

- Fixed Target not selecting some entities when Teams is on and Team Settings is set to All On.
