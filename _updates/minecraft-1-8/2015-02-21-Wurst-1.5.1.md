**Notice:** If you are updating from Wurst 1.4.X or earlier, you need to download & run [Converter.jar](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/releases/download/v1.5/Converter.jar) first. Otherwise your config files are lost!

OK guys, you can stop spamming me about ChestStealer - I fixed *all* of that.

Along with that, I fixed a big bunch of other bugs, including some really old ones like the font looking weird.

Also, you will notice that the file is quite a bit bigger than the last one. That's because I changed my compiler scripts to no longer reobfuscate any changed Minecraft vanilla source code.

Not only does this fix tons of bugs, but it's also a big step towards being able to release **all** of the source code on GitHub and allowing you to compile it locally. In the past, MCP's obfuscator caused tons of issues when trying to do that.
