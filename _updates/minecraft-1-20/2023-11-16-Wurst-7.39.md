- Added TrueSight settings to filter out for hostile mobs, neutral mobs, passive mobs, passive water mobs, bats, slimes, pets, villagers, zombie villagers, golems, piglins, zombie piglins, endermen, shulkers, allays, named mobs and armor stands.

- Added "Facing" and "Swing hand" settings to TreeBot.

- Added a "Filter named" setting to MobESP.

- Added Korean translations for 153 strings. ([#893](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/893) - Thanks to [JAXPLE](https://github.com/JAXPLE)!)

- Added support for the new `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` and `gpt-4-1106-preview` models to AutoComplete.

- Added a "Disable AutoReconnect" setting to AutoLeave. ([#727](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/727) - Thanks to [pcm1k](https://github.com/pcm1k)!)

- Fixed AutoLeave leaving the server if the player is already dead. ([#727](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/727) - Thanks to [pcm1k](https://github.com/pcm1k)!)

- Added a button on the death screen when that lets you quickly enable AutoRespawn. Can be turned off in the AutoRespawn settings. ([#792](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/792) - Thanks to [TheWienerMaster](https://github.com/TheWienerMaster)!)

- Added a "Command" setting to MassTPA, making it possible to use other commands than `/tpa`. ([#899](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/899) - Thanks to [JAXPLE](https://github.com/JAXPLE)!)

- Added a "Delay" setting to MassTPA that lets you change the delay between each teleportation request.

- Added an "Ignore errors" setting to MassTPA. If enabled, MassTPA will continue sending teleportation requests even if the server responds with an error message.

- Added a "Stop when accepted" setting to MassTPA, which you can turn off if you don't want MassTPA to stop when someone accepts your teleportation request.

- Fixed several slider settings saying "1 ticks" instead of "1 tick" when set to a value of 1.

- Fixed X-Ray being unable to hide blocks like grass, snow, and water when Sodium is installed. ([#889](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/889) - Thanks to [ZANX3Y](https://github.com/ZANX3Y)!)

- Fixed TreeBot trying to break leaves while jumping, causing unnecessary slowdowns.

- Fixed `.enchant` not working when the item to enchant is held in the offhand.

- Fixed a bug where an invisible entity would appear visible on the client-side after disabling RemoteView.

- Fixed TreeBot being completely unaware of mangrove trees, cherry trees, and both types of nether tress (huge warped/crimson fungus). TreeBot still won't be able to chop most of these trees due to their large size, but at least it can now see them and pathfind through their leaves.

- Fixed some edge cases with TreeBot's block breaking logic.

- Updated the text in the Wurst Options screen.
