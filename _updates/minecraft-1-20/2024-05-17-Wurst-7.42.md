## Changelog

- Added a "Swing hand" setting to many different hacks: AnchorAura, CrystalAura, FightBot, Killaura, KillauraLegit, MultiAura, Protect, TriggerBot, TP-Aura.

- For KillauraLegit, the hand swing can't be turned off completely, as that wouldn't be legit.

- Added a "Simulate mouse click" checkbox to TriggerBot. This can be used to trick other client-side mods, like CPS meters, into thinking you attacked manually. However, simulating mouse clicks can lead to some unexpected behavior and will prevent TriggerBot's "Swing hand" and "Attack while blocking" settings from working.

  ![A side-by-side video of TriggerBot attacking with and without the "Simulate mouse clicks" option. The TipTapShow CPS mod is installed to show the difference.](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/assets/10100202/229da74c-9fb7-4fa4-9645-56511ac02929)

- Added an "Aim while blocking" setting to AimAssist. By default, AimAssist will no longer aim when you are blocking. ([#947](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/947))

- Added `sculk_sensor`, `sculk_shrieker`, `sculk_catalyst`, and `budding_amethyst` to X-Ray's default list of ores. (Remember to reset your X-Ray list when updating from an older version.)

- From now on, BlockListSettings, ItemListSettings, and BookOffersSettings that are left at their default values (like X-Ray's list of ores for many people) will be updated automatically when the default list changes. So in future updates, you won't have to reset your X-Ray list anymore.

- BonemealAura can now also use bone meal from your offhand.

- Tillaura can now also use a hoe in your offhand.

- Improved how BonemealAura and Tillaura right click on blocks to be more reliable and consistent with vanilla.

- Added "Wait time" and "Wait time randomization" sliders to AntiAFK. ([#982](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/982))

- Added "AI range" and "Non-AI range" sliders to AntiAFK, which determine how far AntiAFK can move the player away from the starting position when "Use AI" is enabled or disabled, respectively.

  ![screenshot of new AntiAFK settings](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/assets/10100202/6d0822c3-d332-41b5-98c5-9a18994bb254)

- Added a description to AntiAFK's "Use AI" setting.

- Improved the description of TriggerBot's "Attack while blocking" setting.

- Searching for "AutoAttack" or "AutoClicker" will now find TriggerBot.

- Searching for "SneakSafety", "SpeedBridge", or "BridgeHelper" will now find SafeWalk.

- Searching for "Fertilizer" or "AutoBonemeal" will now find BonemealAura.

- Searching for "HakList", "HaxList", or "HacksList" will now find HackList.

- Fixed TriggerBot's swing animation looking slightly different than a normal attack in vanilla. ([#988](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/988))

  (This GIF is intentionally slowed down.)

- Fixed the "Filter hostile mobs" setting also filtering out neutral mobs.

- Fixed the "Filter passive mobs" and "Filter babies" settings also filtering out hoglins.

- FeedAura's "Filter horse-like animals" setting is now disabled by default in Minecraft versions where MC-233276 (the bug that caused horses to consume infinite food) has been fixed.

- Updated AntiWaterPush for better compatibility with other mods.

- Improved compatibility with [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), making it possible to use Wurst with Forge mods in Minecraft 1.20.1. It's still very buggy though. ([#924](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/924))

- AutoEat and AutoSoup can no longer be enabled at the same time, as they would constantly fight over which food item to eat.

- Re-worded the chat message when a new Wurst update is available for your Minecraft version.

- Updated the list of OpenAI models in AutoComplete. The default model is now `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`.

- Added "Custom model" and "Custom model type" settings to AutoComplete. If set, this overrides the model you choose in the "OpenAI model" dropdown. Can be used on its own to access fine-tuned OpenAI models, or together with the custom endpoint settings to use any OpenAI-compatible API.

- AutoComplete's "Max suggestions per draft" setting now generates all the suggestions at once, rather than one at a time.

- AutoComplete's "Temperature" setting now defaults to 1, and "Frequency penalty" defaults to 0.

- Removed the "API provider", "Repetition penalty", and "Encoder repetition penalty" settings from AutoComplete. These were all related to the old oobabooga API, which doesn't exist anymore. Use oobabooga's new OpenAI-compatible API instead.

- Fixed VanillaSpoof not working correctly in Minecraft 1.20.4 and later versions. ([#948](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/948))

- Fixed the up/down arrows not cycling through your recent .commands like they do with /commands.

- Fixed a crash when trying to load a keybind profile that doesn't end in `.json`. ([#951](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/951))

- Fixed a division by zero error leading to "Invalid entity rotation" entries in the logs.

- Fixed the LSD hack not working in Minecraft 1.20.5/6.

- Fixed FastBreak slowing down significantly after you click on an unbreakable block. ([#962](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/962))

- Fixed clicking on the primary action button in Navigator sometimes affecting settings behind it.

- Fixed some unnecessary draw calls in Navigator.
