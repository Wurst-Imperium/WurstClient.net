## Changelog

- Fixed a [security vulnerability](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-265322) affecting Minecraft 1.20 and later versions, which allowed servers to detect if Wurst is installed by abusing Minecraft's sign editing and text translation features.

- As a precaution against potential other text translation exploits, Minecraft's chat messages, written books, signs, keybinds, etc. can no longer resolve any of Wurst's translation keys or keybinds.

- Note that other client-side mods may still be vulnerable to this exploit if they haven't implemented similar countermeasures. If you are using any other client-side mods besides Wurst, it is recommended to use a mod like [Mod Detection Preventer](https://modrinth.com/mod/moddetectionpreventer) to avoid getting banned by overzealous server admins.

- Fixed Wurst's zoom keybind being visible in Minecraft's Key Binds menu. It now only appears in the Wurst Options where it belongs.

- This update was initially released for Minecraft 1.20.4 and 1.20.2, then backported to 1.20.1, 1.20.3, and 1.20.
