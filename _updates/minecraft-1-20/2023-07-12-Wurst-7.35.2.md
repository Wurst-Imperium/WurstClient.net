## Changelog

- Wurst now allows you to join servers that have been banned by Mojang, so you can once again enjoy your pixelated CSGO clones. ;)

- [NoChatReports](https://wurst.wiki/nochatreports) now shows up in ClickGUI under the "Chat" category. This should help to reduce confusion when playing on servers that kick you for sending unreportable chat messages.

- Improved compatibility with other mods, such as [Gate of Babylon](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gate-of-babylon) and [Glassential](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/glassential). Using these mods together with Wurst should no longer cause the game to crash.

- By default, [NoFall](https://wurst.wiki/nofall) will now pause itself while you are flying with an elytra, to ensure that it doesn't interfere with your flight. This means it will no longer protect you from taking fall damage during the flight (e.g. flying straight down into the ground), but it will still protect you immediately after the flight (e.g. falling down because you crashed into a wall or broke your elytra).

- If you need protection from the fall damage of flying straight down and don't mind the occasional glitchiness, you can restore NoFall's old behavior by enabling the "Allow elytra" checkbox in the settings.

- Fixed [a crash](https://wurstforum.net/d/22-game-crashes-upon-starting) when files within the ".Wurst encryption" folder have incorrect permissions. Now this will just disable AltManager's file IO, the same way it does when access to the ".Wurst encryption" folder itself is denied.

- Replaced the Reddit link in the Wurst Options screen and ModMenu with a link to [WurstForum.net](https://wurstforum.net/). For those who haven't heard the news, Reddit recently destroyed itself and we've since moved to a forum of our own.
