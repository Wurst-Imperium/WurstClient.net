## Changelog

- ChestESP will now use different colors for different types of chests:

  - green for normal chests

  - cyan for EnderChests

  - orange for trapped chests

- ChestESP will now remember which chests you opened and show you whether or not they are empty (normal & trapped chests only; limited to 64 chests). This is visualized as follows:

  - bright color for chests that you never opened

  - darker color for chests that contain items

  - gray with colored frame for chests that are empty  
(the colored frame indicates whether it is a normal or trapped chest)
