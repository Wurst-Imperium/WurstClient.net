## Changelog

- Added [NoTelemetry](https://wurst.wiki/notelemetry): Disables the forced telemetry that Mojang introduced in 21w38a.

- Added [NoChatReports](https://wurst.wiki/nochatreports) (MC 1.19+): Much like the [No Chat Reports mod](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports) by [Aizistral](https://github.com/Aizistral), this feature disables the cryptographic signatures that since 1.19 are attached to your chat messages. This protects you from losing your Minecraft account due to chat reports and is enabled by default for your safety. (Technically, unsigned messages can still be reported to Mojang, but they are generally not considered valid evidence and it's unlikely that any action would be taken on such reports.)

- When you join a server that requires chat signatures to be enabled, Wurst will now show a warning screen that lets you choose whether or not to un-block signatures and join. This screen also displays some tips for how to stay safe when chat signatures are enabled. (MC 1.19+)

- Removed Mojang's dishonest "message trust" indicators that try to scare you away from unreportable chat messages. (MC 1.19.1-pre2+)

- Added some real safety indicators that warn you about _reportable_ chat messages. (MC 1.19.1-rc2+)

- Removed Mojang's stupid warning toast that pops up whenever you join a server that is protected against chat reports. (MC 1.19.1-rc2+)

- Added a much more useful warning toast that pops up when you join a server that _isn't_ protected against chat reports. (MC 1.19.1-rc2+)

- Funny how Mojang basically laid all the groundwork for warning users against chat reports, just backwards. I only had to invert the warnings' spawn conditions and change the text a little. :)

- When chat signatures are blocked, Wurst will pretend to the server that you have the No Chat Reports mod installed. This is so that the absence of your signatures does not raise suspicion. It also allows you to join servers that require the No Chat Reports mod. (MC 1.19+)

- Wurst won't pretend to have No Chat Reports installed while VanillaSpoof is enabled, since it would be impossible to have the mod without Fabric. (The chat signatures will still be blocked though.)

- When you join a server that requires the No Chat Reports mod while Wurst is not pretending to have it installed, Wurst will show a screen with buttons to quickly fix your settings so that you can join. (MC 1.19+)

- Added a "Pause on containers" setting to Killaura, MultiAura, FightBot, Protect and TP-Aura. When checked, they won't attack while a container screen (chest, hopper, etc.) is open. This is useful for minigame servers that display chest-like menus.

- KillauraLegit and TriggerBot will no longer attack at all when a container or even the player's inventory screen is open.

- AntiBlind now also blocks the Warden's "darkness" effect. (MC 1.19+) (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/warmbroke">warmbroke</a>!)

- `.vclip <height>` now accepts fractions, e.g. `.vclip 2.5`.

- Added `.vclip (up|down)`. Automatically figures out the correct height to clip through the floor or ceiling. ([#645](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/645) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/C0derK1d">C0derK1d</a>!)

- Added Czech translations for 167 strings. ([#662](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/662) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/LUKISO2">LUKISO2</a>!)

- Added French translations for 164 strings. ([#552](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/552) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Calvineries">Calvineries</a>!)

- Added German translations for 13 strings.

- Fixed `.gm`, `.say`, ForceOP, /home and MassTPA sending their /commands as a chat message instead of running the command. (MC 1.19+) ([#673](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/673) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcm1k">pcm1k</a>!)

- Fixed Striders getting slowed down whenever Jesus is not enabled. ([#483](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/483) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/KosmX">KosmX</a>!)

- Fixed a crash when pressing <kbd>F3</kbd> + <kbd>Escape</kbd>.

- Fixed Jesus glitching out when trying to walk on waterlogged blocks.

- Fixed Jesus not moving up when submerged in lava.

- Fixed `.annoy` adding extra spaces to repeated messages. (MC 1.19+)

- Fixed `.annoy`'s repeated messages being able to trigger Wurst commands.

- Fixed a crash when getting kicked from a server while Wurst is disabled.

- Removed NocomCrash. (MC 1.19+)

- Fixed Navigator's primary action button (the one at the bottom of the screen that usually says "Enable" or "Disable") sometimes not updating its text properly.

- Fixed chat signatures being generated incorrectly when using an alt. (MC 1.19+)
