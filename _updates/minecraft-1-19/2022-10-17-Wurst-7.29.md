## Changelog

- Added "Forward Speed", "Upward Speed" and "Change Forward Speed" settings to BoatFly. ([#556](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/556) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/isjerryxiao">isjerryxiao</a>!)

- You can now press the sprint key while using BoatFly to go down more quickly. (Can't use the sneak key because that would make you exit the boat.)

- Updated BoatFly's description.

- Added "Anti-Kick" and "Anti-Kick Interval" settings to Flight and CreativeFlight. When enabled, these will make you fall a little bit every now and then to prevent you from getting kicked. ([#556](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/556) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/isjerryxiao">isjerryxiao</a>!)

- Split Flight's "Speed" slider into "Horizontal Speed" and "Vertical Speed".

- Added a "Slow sneaking" checkbox to Flight. When enabled, this option reduces your horizontal speed while you are sneaking, so that you don't glitch out when flying down and forward at the same time.

- Added a "Wait time" slider to AutoReconnect. ([#718](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/718) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcm1k">pcm1k</a>!)

- Added a "Delay" slider to AutoTotem. ([#719](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/719) - Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcm1k">pcm1k</a>!)

- Added a "Health" slider to AutoTotem. This effectively turns AutoTotem off while your health is above the specified value.

- Added "Min depth" and "Edge distance" settings to Parkour.
