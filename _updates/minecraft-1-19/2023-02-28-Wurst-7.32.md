**NEW:** Let me know what you think of these changes by reacting with 👍 or 👎.

## Changelog

- Added [AutoLibrarian](https://wurst.wiki/autolibrarian): Automatically trains a villager to become a librarian that sells a specific enchanted book. You can set up an entire trading hall in no time by using this hack!

- AutoLibrarian comes packed with all kinds of useful settings. You can put together a whole shopping list of all the enchanted books you want your villagers to sell, and optionally set a maximum price for each book. There is a whole new GUI just for managing this list.

- But that's not all! AutoLibrarian can even automatically update the list whenever a villager has learned to sell one of the books! The book will either be removed from the list so you don't get it twice, or the maximum price will be adjusted so that the next villager has to sell it for a cheaper price.

- You can also control how the AutoLibrarian interacts with the game to ensure you won't be detected by anti-cheats. The "Facing" setting lets you choose how to face the villager and job site, while the "Swing hand" setting lets you control how to swing your hand when interacting with the villager and job site.

- Once a villager has learned to sell one of the books you want, AutoLibrarian can automatically buy something from the villager to lock in the trade. This means you can run AutoLibrarian in the background while you do other things, without having to worry about the villager changing its trade offers later.

- And lastly, AutoLibrarian includes a "Repair mode" setting so you don't have to worry about it breaking your axe.

- Added [AimAssist](https://wurst.wiki/aimassist): Helps you aim at nearby entities, but won't attack them automatically.

- AimAssist includes a customizable range, rotation speed, field of view, and all of the same entity filters that Killaura and other combat hacks have.

- AimAssist is not tied to your framerate, meaning that its rotation speed won't be affected by things like VSync or the speed of your computer.

- Added [Restock](https://wurst.wiki/restock): Automatically restocks your hand with the selected items from your inventory. ([#558](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/558) - Thanks to [isjerryxiao](https://github.com/isjerryxiao)!)

- [KillauraLegit](https://wurst.wiki/killauralegit) will now aim a lot more smoothly (much like AimAssist).

- Added a "Rotation Speed" slider to KillauraLegit: Determines how fast the player's head will turn towards the target. The default value is 600 degrees per second.

- Just like AimAssist, KillauraLegit also rotates at a speed that is independent of your framerate.

- Added a description to KillauraLegit's "FOV" setting.

- Fixed [NukerLegit](https://wurst.wiki/nukerlegit) not aiming at small blocks correctly.

- Fixed NukerLegit breaking some blocks more slowly than necessary.

- Using NukerLegit as a lawn mower should work much better now. :)

- Fixed a typo in the description of the "Lock ID" setting in NukerLegit and [SpeedNuker](https://wurst.wiki/speednuker).

- Updated the default list of blocks for the "MultiID List" setting in Nuker, NukerLegit and SpeedNuker. They now include all the new deepslate ores and no longer include clay.

- Fixed [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray)'s default list of ores not including `minecraft:deepslate_emerald_ore`.

- As always, these updated default lists won't override your existing settings if you're updating from an older version. Be sure to manually reset them if you want to use the new defaults.

- Generally improved the aiming logic. All hacks that aim at things should now be a little bit harder for anti-cheat plugins to detect.

- Added an "Angle+Dist" option to [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot)'s Priority setting and set it as the new default. This is a hybrid of "Angle" and "Distance" that is usually much better than either one alone at figuring out what you are trying to aim at.

- Added an "Activation chance" slider to [FastBreak](https://wurst.wiki/fastbreak): Only FastBreaks some of the blocks you break, which makes it much harder for anti-cheat plugins to detect. This is much faster than Legit mode and great at bypassing plugins like Vulcan.

- Added a "Max height" slider to [ClickGUI](https://wurst.wiki/clickgui): Determines the maximum height of normal windows. Can also be set to 0 for unlimited height.

- Added a "Max settings height" slider to ClickGUI: Determines the maximum height of settings windows. Can also be set to 0 for unlimited height.

- Added more settings to [NameTags](https://wurst.wiki/nametags): "Unlimited range" (enabled by default), "See-through mode", and "Force nametags". ([#770](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/770) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Added an "Offset" slider to [NoFireOverlay](https://wurst.wiki/nofireoverlay). This allows you to lower the fire overlay instead of removing it completely. ([#762](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/762) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Added an "All GUIs" checkbox to [NoBackground](https://wurst.wiki/nobackground) and fixed NoBackground breaking some screens when the game world is not loaded. ([#766](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/766) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Increased the maximum value of [ArrowDMG](https://wurst.wiki/arrowdmg)'s "Packets" slider to 7000 and changed the increment to 20. The new maximum is high enough to one-shot a Warden with Resistance 4. ([#768](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/768) - Thanks to [biran4454](https://github.com/biran4454)!)

- Fixed the path renderer (used in .path, Excavator, TreeBot, etc.) sometimes rendering everything in black.

- Fixed [AutoFarm](https://wurst.wiki/autofarm) sometimes rendering everything in black.

- Fixed [a crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/WurstClient/comments/10yphhy/minecraft_crashing_upon_joining_world/) when using certain resource packs.

- Fixed chat messages not being logged. ([#764](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/764) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser) and [isjerryxiao](https://github.com/isjerryxiao)!)

- Fixed [AntiWaterPush](https://wurst.wiki/antiwaterpush) affecting other entities besides the player in singleplayer worlds. ([#769](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/769) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Fixed [a crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/WurstClient/comments/11bz0f6/minecraft_crashes_every_time_i_try_to_open_a_world/) when using Fabric API version v0.75.0 or later. As a result, Fabric API versions older than v0.75.0 are no longer supported.
