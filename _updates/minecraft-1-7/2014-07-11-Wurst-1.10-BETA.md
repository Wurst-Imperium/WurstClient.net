## Changelog

- Added `.RenameForceOPEvenThoughTheNameIsTechnicallyCorrect`: The longest command so far. You know what it does. ;)

- Added `.throw`: Changes the speed of Throw or toggles it.

- You can now make a custom [AutoBuild](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autobuild) structure by editing `autobuild_custom.txt`.

- Friends will now be sorted alphabetically.

- Added Keybind Manager.

- Added KillauraLegit.

- Added a new effect to LSD (only visible if your computer supports shaders).

- Added MultiAura.

- Improved [AutoBuild](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autobuild).

- Improved InstantBunker.

- Added NukerLegit.

- Added a slider for the [Killaura range](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/killaura#range).

- Added Throw.

- Added [X-Ray](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/x-ray) Block Manager.

- The Wurst GUI will no longer overlap the F3 debug GUI.

- [Killaura](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/killaura) now uses packets to face entities.

- The slider for the [Killaura](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/killaura) YesCheat+ speed now changes the normal Killaura speed.

- YesCheat+ now limits the [Killaura](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/killaura) speed to 12 attacks per second and the Killaura and [Nuker](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/nuker) range to 4.25 blocks when it's enabled. For instance, if you set the speed to 20 and YesCheat+ is off, the speed will be 20. If you turn YesCheat+ on, the slider will still say 20, but the actual speed will be 12. Once you turn YesCheat+ off, the speed will be 20 again. If you set the speed to something lower than or equal to 12, it won't be affected at all.

- Smaller fixes and improvements.

- Removed AutoAdSign. That was a stupid mod.
