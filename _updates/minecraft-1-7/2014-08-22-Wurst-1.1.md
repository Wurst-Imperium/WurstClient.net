Wurst 1.1 just got released. Here is the changelog:

<pre>
+.enchant
+.vclip
+.tp: Teleports you up to 100 blocks away. Only works on vanilla servers.
+FastBow (works with BowAimbot)
+New & rewritten ForceOP/AuthMeCracker
+ServerFinder: Finds hundreds of griefable servers very quickly.
+You can now export your serverlist. So you can search for griefable servers and then share them.
*Warning messages are now orange instead of red.
*Cleaned up some code to reduce the file size.
*Smaller fixes and improvements
</pre>

The usage of ForceOP/AuthMeCracker hasn't changed much, but I will update the tutorial soon.
Using the ServerFinder is really simple:

- Put a numeric IP (like 109.168.212.27, but not like mineplex.eu) into the IP field.
- (optional) Adjust "Max. threads" to whatever works best for you.
- Click "Search".
- Wait until it's done. It should only take a couple minutes.
- Click "Back".
