## About Wurst
The Wurst Client is a Minecraft hacked client made by Alexander01998. It contains a large variety of cheats that allow you to do things that you couldn't do in vanilla Minecraft.

Wurst is meant as an all-in-one solution for cheating in PVP games, griefing and trolling. Most of its features can bypass server plugins like NoCheat+, AntiAura, MAC, etc. that are supposed to prevent people from cheating.

The features in Wurst are divided into three main categories: [mods](/wiki/Mods/), [commands](/wiki/Commands/) and [special features](/wiki/Special_Features/). All of the features can be managed through the Navigator mod.

Since January 25 2015, Wurst is an open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client) and is looking for [contributors](/wiki/Contributing/part1/).
