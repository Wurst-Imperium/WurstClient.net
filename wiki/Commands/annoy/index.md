title: How to Use .annoy (Annoy & Troll other Players)
layout: wiki
category: Command
---
Annoys another player by repeating everything they say. This might not work on every server, since there are specific requirements to recognize a chat message.

## Syntax
`.annoy <player>` annoys the entered player.

## Example
`.annoy Me` annoys the player "Me" by repeating everything they say. Annoying yourself is generally a bad idea, as it ends in an ever-repeating message.
