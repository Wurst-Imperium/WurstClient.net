## Text Tutorial (Windows+Mac OSX)
First off, if you haven't already, [download Wurst](/download/) and save it somewhere on your computer.

## Windows (Scroll down for Mac OSX)
Then open the Windows Explorer and type `%appdata%` into the address bar, as shown below:

![%appdata%](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546898/69717bf0-e2bc-11e5-82a2-735a988fe721.png)

This will redirect you to a folder named "Roaming". Inside of that folder, go to ".minecraft" and then "versions".

![Minecraft versions folder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546897/69717b1e-e2bc-11e5-983b-af44c46c6191.png)

Now put your downloaded ZIP file into this folder and open it using the Windows Explorer.

![open ZIP file with Windows Explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546899/697544f6-e2bc-11e5-80b5-60ca27023e18.png)

Press the "Extract All" button at the top and press "Extract" again in the dialog that appears.

The versions folder should now contain another folder with the same name as the ZIP file. You don't need the ZIP file anymore, just delete it.

![delete ZIP file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546901/69803758-e2bc-11e5-90f5-1499a5e65eab.png)

Inside of that folder, there will be another folder that is simply named "Wurst". Drag that out of the other folder directly into "versions".

Now that you have the "Wurst" folder, you won't need the other folder anymore. You can delete that as well.

![delete extracted folder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546903/698a86b8-e2bc-11e5-9c00-dc8f8d0d0b8b.png)

That is it in terms of the files and folders. The only thing that's left is adding a Wurst profile in the Minecraft launcher (Scroll Down to Setting up Profile).

## Mac OSX
Drag the .zip File from your Downloads Folder to the Desktop.
Dobble-Klick this File to get a Folder Called "Wurst-Client-v(Current Wurst Version)".
Delete the .zip File.
Klick on the "Go to" Tab on your upper Bar.
Klick on Go to Folder... and paste that in the Window:"~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft/Versions"(Whitout the ").
Then Open the "Wurst-Client-v(Current Wurst Version)" Folder and drag the Folder called "Wurst" in the /Versions Folder.
Close all Finder Windows and Delete the Wurst Files on your Desktop.
Now You need to Set up the Profile.

## Setting up Profile
Start the Minecraft launcher (or restart it if it's already open) and click the "New Profile" button.

![Minecraft launcher > New Profile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/13546904/698f4496-e2bc-11e5-909c-9c65e916caec.png)

That will bring you to the Profile Editor, where you can change a whole bunch of settings. Let's start with the most important one: Set "Use version" to "release Wurst", which is right between "release 1.8" and "release 1.8.1".

All of the other settings are optional, but some of them are quite useful:

- Set "Profile Name" to `Wurst Client` so that you know that this profie is Wurst.

- Append `\instances\Wurst` to the "Game Directory" field so that this profile can't change the settings of your other profiles.

- Set "Launcher Visibility" to "Hide launcher and re-open when game closes". That will bring you back to the launcher when you close Minecraft.

- In "JVM Arguments", replace `-Xmx1G` with `-Xmx4G` so that Minecraft gets more RAM and runs faster (If you have a PC with only 4 GB RAM replace it with `-Xmx2G`).

Lastly, don't forget to save the new profile.

The installation is now complete and you can start Wurst using the "Play" button.
