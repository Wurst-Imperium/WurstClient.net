## Text Tutorial
1. Download and install the latest <a href="https://java.com/download" target="_blank">Java 8</a>.

2. Get rid of your [old](https://java.com/en/download/faq/remove_olderversions.xml) Java 6 or Java 7 installation.

3. If you still can't launch, go to [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net) and download the [latest Minecraft launcher](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/launcher/Minecraft.jar).

4. Install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). The download name should be `jdk-8uXX` Note the numbers. Open MC Launcher and click Edit Profile. Check "Executable" and paste the following:

```
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_XX.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java
```
Replace XX with download numbers and click save profile.


## Troubleshooting
- Do not skip step 2. It is important.

- Can't find your old Java installation? It is usually located at `C:\Program Files\Java\jreX.X.X_XX`.

- Still can't find it? Look where you installed Java 8, it's usually right next to that.

- Use the `Minecraft.jar` launcher, not `Minecraft.dmg`.
