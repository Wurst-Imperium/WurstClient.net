# Code of Conduct
- **Think before you react.** If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding.

- **Don't insult.** Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb", "stupid"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.

- **Be explicit.** Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.

- **Don't use hyperbole.** ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing")

# The Title

- Others should be able to guess what the Issue is about by reading its title.

- **Avoid writing `Wurst`** in the title. It is obvious that your Wiki is about Wurst.

- **Don't put a dot at the end of the title.** It's a headline, not a sentence.

# The Body

- #### Don't include opinions or judgements, only information.
  - "Taco command" :white_check_mark: **good**
  - "Funniest command: taco" :x: **bad**
  
  - **Use proper grammar & Markdown.** If no one can read it, no one can help you.  
If you have never used markdown before, you can [learn it in 3 minutes](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- **Don't put multiple wikis into one wiki.** That makes them impossible organize and will likely get your wiki ignored or removed.

# Example:

>Applies the given amount of damage. The amount of damage must be a number between 1 and 40. This works on both normal servers and NoCheat+ servers, as long as they have fall damage enabled.
>
>## Syntax
>`.damage <amount>` damages the player with the given amount.
>
>## Example
>`.damage 8` deals 8 damage points (4 hearts) to the player.
