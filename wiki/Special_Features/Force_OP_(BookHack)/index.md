title: How to Use Book Hack (Force OP with a Book)
layout: wiki
category: Special Feature
---
BookHack allows you to insert links that execute commands into writable books.

The nice thing about it is that no one can see that the book text is a link, so you can trick admins into executing `/op <your_name>` or `/pex user <your_name> add *` and normal players into executing `/kill` or `/money pay <your_name> <lots_of_money>`.

## Usage
1. Craft a writable book.
2. Type some text into it. Preferably a URL so that people will click on it.
3. Click <kbd>Sign</kbd> and give it a title.
4. Click <kbd>Command Link</kbd> and type in your command.
5. Click <kbd>Done</kbd>.
6. Give it to the admin or to the person you want to troll.

## Troubleshooting
- **You need Minecraft 1.8** on the server. Servers that run Minecraft 1.7 do not support books with links.

- **It's not patched.** Spigot is very slowly working on a patch, but they are nowhere near it. All others (Bukkit, Mojang, etc.) don't even care about it.

- **Only admins can use admin commands.** If you want to `/op` yourself, you must give the book to an admin, not just any random player.

## Skype Tutorial ;)
![someone on Skype complaining about BookHack not working despite never having used it](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11584045/13553705/23e6f572-e39a-11e5-95f1-64e1123db0dd.jpg)

Please don't be like this. At least give the mod a try before saying that it doesn't work. Just like this random person on Skype, you will notice that it actually **does** work if you use it correctly.
