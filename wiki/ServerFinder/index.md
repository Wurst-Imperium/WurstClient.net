## About
The Wurst Client ServerFinder is a tool for finding griefable Minecraft servers quickly and with very little effort. It usually finds around 50 servers per minute.

## Usage
1. **Get an IP** to start with. Just [Google `minecraft server ip`](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=FCnXVKG8CIbCUK77gPAB#q=minecraft+server+ip&tbs=qdr:d) and you're good to go.

<br>
<br>

2. **Convert the IP.** If the IP you found looks like `109.168.212.27`, you can skip this step. If it has something like `:25565` at the end, remove that. If it looks like `mineplex.eu`, [open the console](http://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows) and type `ping YOUR_IP`. You will then see an IP that looks like `109.168.212.27`.

<br>
<br>

3. **Start ServerFinder** with the converted IP. The `Max. threads` option below the IP field determines how many servers it can check at the same time. The higher this number is, the faster it will be, but it will also cause more lag.

<br>
<br>

4. **Run a Clean Up** once ServerFinder is done. Some of the servers that it found will be broken and Clean Up will remove these broken servers.

5. **That's it!** I found 96 servers this time. How many can you find?
