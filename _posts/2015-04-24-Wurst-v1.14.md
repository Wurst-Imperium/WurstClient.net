Wurst v1.14 is the last update before Wurst v2.0.

Planned features for Wurst v2.0:

- **Pure Java 8** - Wurst already requires Java 8, but doesn't use its full potential yet.

- **Advanced GUI** - In Wurst v2.0, the GUI will support more advanced components like scrollbars and text fields. It and can even be dragged outside of the Minecraft window.

- **Minecraft 1.8.3** - Updating from Minecraft 1.8 to Minecraft 1.8.3 will massively increase the performance.
