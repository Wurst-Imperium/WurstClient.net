## Changelog

- :rocket: Lots of performance improvements, including a faster ModManager, CommandManager and FileManager.

- :new: ClickAura: Automatically attacks the closest valid entity whenever you click. Warning: ClickAuras generally look more suspicious than Killauras and are easier to detect. It is recommended to use Killaura or TriggerBot instead.

- :new: MenuWalk: Allows you to walk while viewing a menu (e.g. the inventory menu)

- :new: #1925 `.repair` Command: Repairs items in Creative Mode.

- :star: Improved Wurst capes and added support for Wurst HD skins. Those will hopefully be available soon.

- :gem: Cleaned up lots of code.

## Update: Wurst 2.11.1
