This update is part 1/4 of the Format update. Part 1 changed the way config files work, so it's important to **use the converter** if you don't want to lose your config files, part 2 will change the way alts work (and there will be a converter as well), part 3 will change the way keybinds work, so that you can bind commands to keys instead of just mods, and finally part 4 will change the way custom AutoBuild templates (which are now called templates instead of structures) work, so that you can use multiple custom templates or even delete the default ones.

I have also added some new downloads to the [downloads page](/downloads), including [AutoBuild templates](/downloads/add-ons/autobuild), [WSPAM scripts](/downloads/add-ons/wspam-scripts) (which were mostly submitted by fans) and a nice looking [Wurst Client wallpaper](/downloads/fans/wallpapers) for the real fans. If *you* want to submit any of the above, [create an Issue](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/wurst-client.tk/issues) on this website's GitHub repo.

I want to get back into the habit of releasing a Wurst update every Friday, so Wurst v1.6 might already come next week.
