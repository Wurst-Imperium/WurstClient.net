> **Notice:** Wurst detects your Java version with 100% accuracy.
>
> If Wurst says that you are not using Java 8, then you are not using Java 8. Period.  
> Furthermore, all of the following methods are proven to work every time (if done correctly).

# Method 1: Install Java 8 properly![](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-52838431-1/GitHub/wiki/Using-Wurst-with-Java-8?pixel)
1. [**Download Java 8**](http://java.com/download) from Java.com.

2. **Install it.** If you need help with that, read the [installation guide](http://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml) on Java.com.

3. **Uninstall all older Java versions.** Java.com has a [tutorial](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml) on this as well.
> 3\. is the most important step. Make sure you do it correctly.

4. **Done!**
### Additional Steps for MAC/Linux Computers
1. Make sure you have installed Java 8 using the steps in Method 1
2. Go into Terminal and Execute the following **
   > which java
   
   > ls -l ```OUTPUT OF ABOVE COMMAND```

3. Copy that path into the ```Executable``` field in the ```Edit Profile``` option in the launcher.


# Method 2: Use the new Minecraft launcher
> **WARNING:** This method will not remove any of your old Java installations. Keeping them installed is **highly insecure**!

1. [**Download the new Minecraft launcher**](https://launcher.mojang.com/download/Minecraft.exe) from Mojang.com.

2. **Install it.**

3. **Done!** This launcher has the latest Java 8 built-in, so it will never attempt to launch Wurst with an old version.

# Method 3: Get Windows
It is much easier to use Java 8 with Windows!

1. [**Get Windows.**](http://windows.microsoft.com/)
2. Get the [**new launcher](minecraft.net/download**) 
3. **Done!**
