      <h2>Before You Ask</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Do you have a Discord server?</b><br>
          No, not anymore. <u>Discord has deleted our server and banned (as far as I know) every single user who had joined it.</u> They don't want people to talk about cheating in video games. Reddit, however, doesn't have nonsense-rules like that. So now we have a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WurstClient/">subreddit</a>. And no, I won't make another Discord server. I'm tired of making new Discord accounts, loosing all my contacts, messages, etc. every time.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>How do I install Wurst? What do I do with the downloaded files?</b><br>
          Please read our <a href="/tutorials/wurst-7-optifine/">installation tutorial</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>I have Minecraft 1.12.2. Why does the Wurst MC 1.12 installer say that it couldn't find my Minecraft installation?</b><br>
          You need Minecraft 1.12, not 1.12.2. Open the Minecraft launcher, create a profile using "release 1.12" and launch it once. Then the installer will work.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Why can't I run the cross-platform Wurst 6 installer? (Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12, file ends in .JAR)</b><br>
          Maybe you don't have Java installed (or you are using an outdated version). Maybe you have configured your computer to open .JAR files with some other program than Java. Or maybe you are simply using "java.exe" instead of "javaw.exe".</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Which key opens the GUI? How do change my keybinds? etc.</b><br>
          Please read our <a href="/tutorials/dot-binds-command/">.binds command tutorial</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Help! My X-Ray is not working.</b><br>
          Are you seeing fake ores everywhere? That's a server plugin that's meant to break X-Ray. There is unfortunately nothing we can do about that. Are you seeing everything as if X-Ray was turned off? That's a bug in OptiFine version F4. Please use OptiFine F3 instead.</p></li>
