		<h2 class="text-normal">Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>You know how YouTube videos always have that view counter under them? You might be surprised to hear that, by default, websites don't have anything like that. So if I want to know how many people visit my website, then I have to install a plugin for that. The plugin I use is called Google Analytics. As you may have guessed, it's made by Google.</p>
    <p>Aside from the website, I also want to know how many people are using the Wurst Client itself. And for that I use Google Analytics as well.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics has to collect some anonymized data to make the view counting work. They have their own privacy policy which you can view here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p>Since Google Analytics doesn't collect any personal data, there is no good reason to turn it off (aside from saving a tiny bit of internet bandwidth, I guess), but you <i>can</i> turn it off if you want to. To turn off Google Analytics on this website, you will need to install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">GA Opt-Out Browser Plugin</a>. Note that this will turn off Google Analytics on all websites. As far as I know, there is no way to turn it off on just one website.</p>
    <p>Since the Wurst Client can't tell what browser plugins you have installed (and it would be a privacy concern if it could), this plugin won't disable Google Analytics in the Wurst Client. Instead, you can turn it off by going to "Wurst Options" > "Analytics" and setting it to "OFF".</p>

		<h2 class="text-normal">Google AdSense</h2>
    <p>I use Google AdSense to place ads on this website. They have their own privacy policy which you can view here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p>While I don't sell any data to them, they may use data that they already have to "personalize" their ads. You can turn this off by scrolling all the way down and setting the "Personalized Ads" option to "OFF".</p>
    <p>Note that this won't turn off the ads, it just stops them from being personalized.</p>

    <p>Since I don't have your email address, I can't send you one of those annoying "we have updated our privacy policy" e-mails. Instead, I have a GitHub repository where you can see how this page has changed over time: <a href="https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WurstClient.net/commits/gh-pages/privacy.md" target="_blank">https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WurstClient.net/commits/gh-pages/privacy.md</a></p>
