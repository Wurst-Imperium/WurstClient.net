title: Can you please add OptiFine to Wurst?
---
<span class="leader">No.</span>

There are three primary reasons why we never added OptiFine and never will:

1. It's quite buggy, at least it was the last time I used it. For instance, it often causes a crash when opening the Options screen and sometimes it breaks your singleplayer worlds.

2. There is a lot of false hype around it. Too many people think that it's some sort of magic solution to stop lag on crappy computers, but the only real solution is to upgrade your computer or to get a better one. Not to mention that OptiFine prevents many people from getting a better computer and thereby slows down technical progress altogether.

3. It's not allowed to distribute OptiFine in any way (including as part of a hacked client) without written permission from the creator. Most people just ignore that, but we take copyright seriously.ï»¿ We're in it for the long term, and that's the reason why Wurst has been around for such a long time while most other clients appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as quickly as time goes on.

**But I have a crappy computer. What can I do?**

Upgrade or replace it. If you have a desktop PC, chances are you can upgrade it quite easily (and inexpensively).

When most people hear about upgrading their PC, they immediately think about replacing the graphics card and get scared by the high prices of modern graphics cards.

But in reality, and especially for games like Minecraft that don't use a lot of graphical things, your graphics card isn't actually that imprortant.

What matters far more is having a decent processor. I recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/29FbOAZ" target="_blank">AMD FX-8350</a>, which I also use in my own PC.

It's currently the fastest processor on the market and I can almost guarantee you that this thing alone will give you more than enough performance to play Minecraft without ever having to struggle with OptiFine again.

And even though it's such a high-end processor, it's cheaper than even an average performance graphics card. For instance, the <a href="http://amzn.to/29JVcHV" target="_blank">R7 250X</a> is already twice that price.

One thing to note though, make sure that you have an AM3+ socket before getting this processor. It's not compatible to any other sockets.

On the other side, if you have a laptop and you don't want to switch to a desktop PC, there are a few options for you as well.

A friend of mine once had the same problem. He wanted a gaming computer but hated desktops.

He got himself an [Alienware 15](http://amzn.to/29Vx9pz) laptop, through which he is now able to compete with the performance of my desktop PC quite well.

As far as I can tell he is very happy with that thing, but I can't personally recommend it to you because I don't use it myself.

My personal recommendation to you is to use a desktop PC, as that allows you to build a very fast computer very inexpensively - plus you can easily upgrade it later instead of having to get a new one.

Anyways, hope this helps you and thanks for reading!
