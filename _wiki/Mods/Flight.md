## Overview
The Flight mod allows you to fly. It has a configurable speed and includes bypasses for vanilla Minecraft's "Flying is not enabled on this server" kick, the Mineplex AntiCheat system and certain versions of NoCheat+.

## Usage
The basic usage of Flight couldn't be more simple: Turn it on and you fly, turn it off and you don't fly.
You can also configure the speed at which you fly by using the Flight Speed slider on the Navigator page of the Flight mod.

## Bypass
Flight mod bypasses some versions of NoCheat+ and MAC (Mineplex Anti-Cheat), but you have to do it correctly.

In order for Flight to bypass NoCheat+, you first have to activate another mod called YesCheat+. Keep in mind that this bypass will only work on some versions of NoCheat+, but not on all of them.

The way to bypass MAC is similiar, but you have to enable AntiMAC insteam of YesCheat+.
Note that there is one game in Mineplex called "The Bridges" that doesn't use the Mineplex AntiCheat system, but instead uses NoCheat+.

## Important notes
There isn't really a way to find out whether or not a specific server has the right version of NoCheat+ for this bypass or not. Just try it out and see if it works.

The YesCheat+ version of Flight does not allow you to fly any higher than where you started. You can fly down and back up, but not up and back down.

Flight has a "Flight-Kick-Bypass" checkbox that, when checked, protects you from getting kicked for flying. This is a new feature in Wurst 2.19, any previous versions don't have this checkbox. Normally, any Minecraft server (even vanilla ones) will kick you for "Flying is not enabled on this server" if you fly for at least 4 seconds without touching the ground, but this bypass will prevent that from happening.

The fly-kick bypass is incompatible with the NoCheat+ and MAC bypasses, so it will only work if both YesCheat+ and AntiMAC are disabled. Furthermore, it can only protect you while you are flying at most 300m above ground.
