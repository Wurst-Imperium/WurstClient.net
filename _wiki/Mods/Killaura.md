## Overview
Killaura is a mod that automatically attacks everything in your range. 

## Usage
Though generally used for PVP, more advanced filters may be set that allows it to function without harming your teammates. By taking advantage of the [Target](/wiki/Special_Features/Target) feature, you can control what kinds of entities your killaura will attack. This is critical for many of the more modern minigames that put you on teams or replace players with mobs.

## Bypass
Killaura bypasses most cheat detection plugins, and at the time or writing the most modern ones.

There are a few exceptions to this, however. To prevent against killauras, some servers put two invisible entities to either side or behind the player that move with you. When the killaura is activated the player will repeatedly hit these entities, and is kicked. To prevent this, simply uncheck invisible mobs and invisible players in the [Target](/wiki/Special_Features/Target) menu.
