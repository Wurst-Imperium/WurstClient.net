## Overview
AutoSteal is a mod that automatically steals everything from all chests that you open.

## Usage
When AutoSteal is on, you can open the chests and automatically take everything.

## Bypass
AutoSteal bypasses everything, but you must select the right bypass method.

## Important notes
If the server has NoCheat+, you must activate YesCheat+.
If the server has MAC, activate AntiMAC instead of YesCheat+.
